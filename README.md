# OAI

OAI is a collection of lightweight and easy-to-train AI models.  
The goal of this project is not to compete with advanced models like GLM-4.5 or GPT, but to provide **simple, accessible AI implementations** that are easy to understand, train, and extend.

## Features
- Minimal and beginner-friendly codebase  
- Easy training workflows  
- Modular design for experimenting with different ideas  
- Great for learning the basics of AI and ML
